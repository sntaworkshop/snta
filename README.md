International Workshop on Systems and Network Telemetry and Analytics (SNTA)

The tasks of systems and network telemetry are a key element for effective operations and management of HPC and distributed computing systems, by offering comprehensive measurement and analysis capabilities to provide the visibility into what is occurring at any time. The tasks will be significantly complicated with the greater complexity of computing systems, increasing network speed, and the newly introduced mobile and IoT devices. Such changes will render the existing telemetry and analysis techniques to be outdated, and more scalable techniques may be in place for data-driven and deeper data analysis. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative challenges, data pressure in systems and networks also comes from various sources such as sensors, computing systems, networking and security devices, and other \emerging computing elements speaking with different syntax and semantics, which makes organizing and incorporating the generated data difficult for extensive analysis.

This workshop aims at bridging the systems and network measurement and the latest advances in machine learning and data science technologies, to advance the performance and reliability of HPC and distributed systems. New analysis techniques are needed in the modern world, from the diverse angles of systems/network performance, availability, and security. For example, real-time streaming analytics algorithms and methods need to be explored for estimating network performance and summarizing the traffic variables to capture the network activities due to the network bandwidth increase. Multivariate analysis of telemetric variables may be able to provide the intuitive, comprehensive view of the systems and networks dynamics. New logging techniques are also needed in the future with the latest development in the storage and archival technologies. In addition, many applications in this area may need to address the application-specific requirements and challenges. This workshop intends to share visions of investigating new approaches and methods at the intersection of data sciences and HPC/distributed computing systems.
